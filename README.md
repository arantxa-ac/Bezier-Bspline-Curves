# Bezier-Bspline-Curves
Assignment for Introduction to Computer Graphics course. Assignment specifications and skeleton code provided by Faramarz Samavati.

This assignment was programmed in OpenGL for the course Introduction to Computer Graphics. For all assignments in this course we were provdided by instructor Faramarz Samavati with a skeleton code that included classes for elements such as textures and shaders. My work for this assignment was only present in main.cpp file as well as the vertex shader.
The task was to create an interactive program that calculates bezier and bspline curves from given points. These points can be added by clicking (see my cat cursor) anywhere on the window or modified by clicking and dragging points. The type of curve is changed through key input. This program also had to be able to see the curve in a 3D space which could be explored through key and mouse input. Finally a scene had to be added to display the points of the surface of revolution created from the bspline curve.
